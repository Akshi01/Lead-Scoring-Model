# Lead-Scoring-Model

Lead scoring models are pivotal in modern business strategies, streamlining the identification of promising leads for conversion. By harnessing data analytics and machine learning, these models assign scores to leads, predicting their likelihood of becoming customers. This predictive capability optimizes resource allocation, directing efforts towards leads with the highest potential. In this project, we focus on crafting a bespoke lead scoring model tailored to our business needs. Our goal is to revolutionize lead qualification, accelerate sales pipelines, and propel business expansion.
